# 📊 Insights into Customer Shopping Behavior

## 📌 Project Overview
Insights into Customer Shopping Behavior is a data analytics project where I analyze customer purchasing patterns, preferences, and demographics to deliver actionable business insights. Using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, I developed an interactive dashboard to support data-driven retail decision-making.
