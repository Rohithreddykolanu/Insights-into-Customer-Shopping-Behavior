# Insights-into-Customer-Shopping-Behavior
Insights into Customer Shopping Behavior is a data analytics project where I analyze customer purchasing patterns, demographics, revenue trends, product categories, subscriptions, and shipping preferences using Python, SQL, and Power BI. I present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard to support data-driven retail decisions.
